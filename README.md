Clock IN is an application that gives people the possibility to register their shifts and then automatically calculate their paychecks. The main aim of the application is to give workers without fixed salaries a better overview over their total salary. Clock IN also gives you the opportunity to add cash goals that will help you save up money or make sure that you break even on your monthly expenses. The app is also meant to be a useful tool when controlling  the paychecks you receive from your workplace. The app is financed by ads and in-app- purchase (monthly subscription), where video ads will only be shown when "Clocking-in" if a  user does not have a subscription.
